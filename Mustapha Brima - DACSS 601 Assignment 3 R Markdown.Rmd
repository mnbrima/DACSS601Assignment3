## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
#The data found in the covid-responses.tab.xlsx file was a result of the 
#findings of how Italian peoples responded to the first few days living 
#in the COVID-19 Pandemic. The data displays the different opinions and 
#preferences of Italian citizens as they began to go about their regular 
#day-to day practices while being in quarantine and not being able to 
#venture outside of their homes. The Italian government had conducted 
#this study in an effort to make quarantine more suitable while having 
#its citizens follow public health guidelines as they pertained to the 
#pandemic as they would "...need interventions that make staying following 
#public health protocols more desirable" 
#(https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/1SBQCX). 
#The only values that seem to be missing in the data are names and emails 
#of each participant which were most likely kept confidential. As for 
#other aspects, the 'finish' variable only shows either ones or nothing at all, 
#while the 'UserLanguage' variable doesn't properly display the language that 
#each participant speaks. 
#I have attempted to rewrite the data for the finish and UserLanguage variables 
#so that one variable indicates whether they completed the survey or not 
#('finish') by returning TRUE instead of '1' and FALSE instead of 'NA'. While 
#the other veriable (UserLanguage), I have made to more adequately display the 
#language spoken by each participant of the survey as 'IT' would be for Italian and 
# 'EN' would be for English.
